biodegradable-eyelid-wipes-for-eyelid-cleaning-20ct,Biodegradable Eyelid Wipes for Eyelid Cleaning 20ct,"The Eye Doctor Eyelid Wipes are pre-soaked with a sterile, preservative-free saline solution to create an efficient, gentle remedy for daily eyelid hygiene.How do the Eyelid Wipes work?Eyelid Wipes are ideal for cleaning away dirt and debris from the eyelid and eyelashes without irritation. The soap-free, rinse-free formula maintains the lipid layer of the tear film which is essential in reducing tear evaporation. Without this layer, eyes can become very dry and irritated. The Eyelid Wipes should be used twice a day – morning and evening, as part of your eyelid hygiene regime.

What makes the Eyelid Wipes Biodegradable?
Made from Viscose fibres, our wipes are fully biodegradable in natural environments: in the soil, compost and both fresh or marine water. They will fully convert back to nature and do not require recycling. At The Body Doctor, we recognise that being sustainable is becoming a necessity due to ever-changing perceptions around the world and we are starting to bridge the gap between ‘knowing’ and ‘doing,’ by embracing sustainable products, packaging and practises. We believe our eyelid wipes being biodegradable is a first for the optical industry and we are dedicated to continue this initiative across our whole portfolio, reducing as much impact to the environment as possible.

Extended-wear lenses should be regularly removed for cleaning and disinfecting or for disposal and replacement on the schedule prescribed by your eye care professional.
Clinical studies have shown that there is an increased incidence of serious adverse reactions in extended-wear contact lens users as compared to daily-wear contact lens users. Studies have also shown that the risk of serious adverse reactions increases the longer extended- wear lenses are worn before removal for cleaning and disinfecting or for disposal and replacement.
Studies have also shown that smokers had a higher incidence of adverse reactions. It is recommended that contact lens wearers see their eye care professional once a year or, if directed, more frequently.

If you notice any of the above, IMMEDIATELY remove and examine your lenses. If a lens appears to be damaged, do not reapply; consult your eye care professional. If the problem stops and the lenses appear to be undamaged, follow the “Directions” below, before reapplying the lens.
If the problem continues, IMMEDIATELY remove your lenses, discontinue use of all lens care products that contact the eye and consult your eye care professional.

Seek immediate professional identification of the problem and obtain treatment if necessary, to avoid serious eye damage.

Studies have also shown that smokers had a higher incidence of adverse reactions. It is recommended that contact lens wearers see their eye care professional once a year or, if directed, more frequently.

Aqueous Tear Deficient:Not enough tears made.

	RUB your lens gently from the center to the edges for at least 10 seconds (never rub in a circular motion, because it may tear the lens and not clean the outer edge surface).
	After rubbing for at least 10 seconds, turn the lens over and repeat step 3.
	RINSE each side of the lens for 5 seconds with fresh COMPLETE® Multi-Purpose Solution EASY RUB® Formula. Place lenses in clean COMPLETE® lens case and fill with COMPLETE® Multi-Purpose Solution EASY RUB® Formula. Close COMPLETE® lens case tightly.
	SOAK – Allow lenses to soak for a minimum of six (6) hours for disinfection, cleaning and protein removal.


EXTRA CLEANING AND COMFORT

WARNINGS

PROBLEMS WITH CONTACT LENSES AND LENS CARE PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY TO THE EYE. It is essential that you follow your eye care professional’s directions and all labeling instructions for proper use and care of your lenses and lens care products, including the lens case. You should follow the recommended lens rubbing and rinsing times to adequately disinfect lenses. Reduced rubbing or rinsing times may not adequately clean your lenses. EYE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING CORNEAL ULCERS, CAN DEVELOP RAPIDLY AND LEAD TO LOSS OF VISION.

You should fill your lens case with fresh solution every time you store your lenses and never “top off” or reuse solution. You should discard your solution immediately after your lenses have been removed from the lens case. You should not expose or store your lenses in or rinse your lens case with any water such as tap, bottled, distilled or with any non-sterile solution. Clean, rinse and dry your lens case each time you remove your lenses. In order to permit excess solution to drain, flip your lens case over and allow it to air dry. Replace your lens case every 1-3 months, depending on your hygiene habits.

Daily wear lenses are not indicated for overnight wear and should not be worn while sleeping. Clinical studies have shown that the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when these lenses are worn overnight.

Extended wear lenses should be regularly removed for cleaning and disinfection or for disposal and replacement on the schedule provided by your eye care professional.

Clinical studies have shown that there is an increased incidence of serious adverse reactions in extended wear contact lens users as compared to daily wear contact lens users. Studies also have shown that the risk for serious adverse reactions increases the longer extended wear lenses are worn before removal for cleaning and disinfection or for disposal and replacement.

Studies also have shown that smokers had a higher incidence of adverse reactions. It is recommended that contact lens wearers see their eye care professional once a year or, if directed, more frequently.

To avoid contamination, do not touch the tip of the COMPLETE® Multi-Purpose Solution EASY RUB® Formula bottle to any surface. Replace cap after using.

PRECAUTIONS


	Avoid exposure to water when wearing and caring for your contact lenses.
	Discard any remaining solution in your lens case before re-disinfecting. Always use fresh solution.
	Rinse lens case and caps with fresh solution after each use; dry upside down on a clean towel. Do not use non-sterile water to rinse lens case.
	Always wash your hands and then dry with a clean, lint-free towel before handling lenses.
	Use the included lens case with COMPLETE® Multi-Purpose Solution EASY RUB®.
	Replace your lens case every 1–3 months.
	Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use.
	Store at room temperature.
	Use before the expiration date marked on the bottle and carton. DISCARD SOLUTION 90 DAYS AFTER OPENING.
	Never use COMPLETE® Multi-Purpose Solution EASY RUB® Formula with a heat disinfection unit.
	Keep out of the reach of children.


ADVERSE REACTIONS (PROBLEMS AND WHAT TO DO)

The following problems may occur: eyes sting, burn or itch (irritation); comfort is less than when lens was first placed on the eye; feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area); excessive watering (tearing) of the eye; unusual eye secretions; redness of the eye; reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity); blurred vision; rainbows or halos around objects; sensitivity to light (photophobia); or dry eyes. If you notice any of the above:

IMMEDIATELY REMOVE YOUR CONTACT LENSES


	If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens.
	If the lens is in any way damaged, DO NOT put the lens back on your eye. Place the lens in the COMPLETE® lens case and contact your eye care professional.
	If the lens has dirt, an eyelash, or other foreign body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears undamaged, thoroughly clean, rinse and disinfect the lens and then reinsert it.
	If the problem continues, IMMEDIATELY remove the lens and consult your eye care professional.
	If any of the above symptoms occur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, neovascularization or iritis may be present. Seek immediate professional identification of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.


GOOD LENS CARE PRACTICES


	Follow your eye care professional's instructions.
	Always wash your hands before handling your lenses.
	Rub, rinse and disinfect your lenses each time you remove them.
	Always handle the same lens, the right or the left, first in order to avoid mix-ups.
	Do not expose lenses or lens case to tap water, bottled water, distilled water, lake water, or ocean water.
	Do not swim, shower or use a hot tub while wearing soft contact lenses.
	Do not use saliva or put lenses in mouth to rewet.
	Do not wear lenses longer than prescribed.
	Discard any soft lens that is damaged or dehydrated.

How it works:Omega-3 deficient glands may become inflamed and clogged which accelerates tear evaporation and dryness due to missing oil.  Studies show that long-term consumption of 2240mg of EPA &amp; DHA in the re-esterified triglyceride form (rTg) may help to maintain a healthy tear film and assist in overall eye comfort.¹



PRODUCT FAQs

Q: How does De 3 compare to store-bought fish oil?A: De 3 contains 2240mg of EPA and DHA in an ultra-purified triglyceride (rTG) form, which is a similar form to a piece of fish, but without the impurities. This form is easier for your body to absorb and micro-distilled to remove contaminants like PCBs, lead, mercury and more.  Many store-bought omega-3s contain less than 600mg of EPA and DHA and are in a synthetic (ester) or unpurified form, which is difficult to absorb and leaves a fishy odor/aftertaste.
Q: Can I get a sufficient amount of Omega-3s from just eating fish?A: The American Heart Association and the American Cardiology Association recommend 2-3 grams of omega-3s daily (EPA+DHA). To get this amount of Omega 3s (generally equal to 3 soft gels of PRN Omega 3s daily) from eating fish, you would have to consume the equivalent of 37 cans of tuna per week! Eating this much fish could result in an increased risk for mercury poisoning. Other fish that can be purchased in stores are mostly farm-raised which have little Omega-3s, or wild-caught, which are optimal but have an increased risk of being contaminated with harmful PCBs, dioxins, mercury, etc.
Q:  Why not Flaxseed oil?A: Flaxseed contains the plant source of Omega-3s, also known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). This form is less easy to absorb and less effective in the body. Marine-based Omega-3s have been shown to be more absorbable which may provide systemic benefits.*

How Do the Ingredients Provide Targeted Nutritional Support?






Ingredient(s)
Category
Rationale
Evidence*


Beta-Carotene,Vitamin Cand Vitamin E
Antioxidants
Diabetics often have increased oxidative stress – a factor in many diabetic compli-cations. Both type 1 &amp; 2, and those with retinopathy, often have lower blood antioxidant levels.
Evidence suggests antioxidants with different activities form a synergistic network against oxidative stress. Vitamin C highly concentrated in the eye; blood levels inversely associated with diabetes risk over long term. Long-term C,E and/or multi use reportedly linked to 2-fold lower retinopathy risk. Dietary beta-carotene found to be less bioavailable than previously known, particularly in women. Blood levels reportedly significantly lower in diabetics than controls. Evidence suggests vitamin E doses that can obtained from the diet contribute to lower oxidative stress in diabetes


Thiamin (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacinamide (B3) Pyridoxine (B6), Folic Acid, Cobalamin (B12),and Biotin
B-vitamins
Ensure adequate intake and help maintain B vitamin balance
Research shows type 1 &amp; 2 excrete more thiamin and have low blood levels. Thiamin active in glucose metabolism; low levels raise risk of kidney, nerve and eye complications in animals. Diabetics have greater cataract risk; riboflavin and thiamin linked to decreased risk. Broad-spectrum antioxidant supplementation may be more effective than single nutrients. Some studies link multis with lower cataract risk; in AREDS analysis, long-term use lowered cataract risk Folic acid, B6 and B12 help maintain healthy homocysteine (HC) levels. Elevated HC observed in those with diabetic retinopathy. Older people at higher risk of low B12, which plays critical role in nerve function. Biotin-containing enzymes involved in glucose metabolism.


Vitamin D
Essential fat soluble vitamin
Ensures healthy blood levels and reduce risk of CVD
Analyses find 1,000 IU daily needed to bring ½ of population into vitamin D blood level range linked with multiple health endpoints. Low vitamin D prevalent in type 2 diabetic adults and is strongly associated with narrowing of carotid artery. Vitamin D (and calcium insufficiency) also may harm glucose metabolism. Decreased vitamin D linked with CVD in type 2 patients with mild kidney dysfunction. For lowering risk of type 2 in women, evidence shows &gt;800 IU is significantly better than 400 IU.


Magnesium, Zinc, Chromium
Essential minerals
Offset increased urinary losses and ensure good status
Those with poor glucose control often low in magnesium. Research consistently links magnesium intake with reduced hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Zinc active in insulin metabolism. Increased insulin secretion associated with greater urinary zinc loss in type 1 &amp; 2. Zinc needed for activity of key antioxidant enzyme. Chromium facilitates insulin activity. Evidence suggests chromium supports healthier blood glucose levels in those low in chromium who have impaired glucose tolerance.


Pine Bark Extract
Polyphenols
Strengthens leaky capillaries
Pine bark components tested in 1200 people with retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy (open and controlled trials); results indicate delay of progression. Clinically reported to protect retinal function in retinopathy caused by diabetes, other causes. Preliminary clinical results suggest improved microcirculation and symptoms in diabetes, neuropathy and edema. In type 2 patients on ACE inhibitors, clinical reports improved blood pressure control. In animals, inhibits diabetic retinopathy progression, may reduce retinopathy and cataract formation. Human study indicates components exert anti-inflammatory effects through pro-inflammatory gene inhibition.


Quercetin
Flavonoid
Clinically, reduces oxidative stress
In diabetics fed high or low quercetin diet, significantly reduced DNA damage in lymphocytes ex-vivo. A potent antioxidant, quercetin shown to inhibit enzyme mediating Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) – VEGF induces vascular permeability, plays role in retinopathy development.In vitro, quercetin shown to protect retinal pigment epithelial and cortical cells from oxidative stress. Large-scale studies link quercetin-rich diets with lower CVD risk. Shown to accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions whereit plays role in reducing LDL buildup.


Lutein
Antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties, component of macular pigment
Doubles average U.S. lutein intake to help support retinal and artery health
Several studies report low plasma lutein in patients with coronary artery disease or progressive thickening of carotid artery lining. In animal diabetes model, lutein reportedly lowers retinal oxidative stress. Some, though not all, epidemiologic studies link higher intake with lower cataract risk.


Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)
Antioxidant
May help protect micro-vessels
ALA acts as antioxidant, appears to regenerate other antioxidants like glutathione. In diabetic retinopathy animal models, high doses protect against micro-vascular damage. Numerous well-controlled trials show ALA reduces sensory symptoms in diabetic neuropathy with 600-1200 mg/day.

Can DiaVis be Taken with Diabetes-related Medications?





Yes, though as with any dietary supplement, patients with medical conditions and/or using prescription medications should inform their primary care doctor when adding DiaVis to their daily regimen.
While potential interactions between medications and DiaVis ingredients appear to be minimal, routine monitoring is prudent. Aninteraction chartprovides information about potential interactions of DiaVis ingredients with common anti-diabetic medications and tests, and takes into account other drugs used to prevent or treat diabetic complications such as cardiovascular, kidney, eye and peripheral nerve disease.
Some diabetes-related medications can also interfere with metabolism of certain nutrients, which may need to be supplemented. These ingredients are included in DiaVis, and are also identified within the chart.

Can DiaVis be Taken with other Dietary Supplements?


DiaVis can be used as a stand-alone formula, though those who don’t meet recommended calcium intake may need supplemental calcium. It is highly recommended that DiaVis be taken in conjunction with ScienceBasedHealth’s OmegaAdvance®, a concentrated source of omega-3 fatty acids (see P.1). DiaVis may also be combined with most modest potency, one-a-day multi-nutrient supplements without exceeding the Upper Intake Level of essential vitamins and minerals.

Many eyeliners, especially when applied to the waterline, can cause allergic reactions and irritation as well as potentially lead to dry eye disease later in life. This ophthalmologist-tested liquid liner formula won’t flake off, stain, or otherwise irritate the eye while adding definition to your lash line. With regular use, the eye-safe ingredients also promote thicker, fuller-looking lashes over time.
















Ingredient Highlights

Castor oil: Natural ingredient used by ophthalmologists as a topical dry eye treatment; contains moisturizing ricinoleic acid that promotes hair follicle health
Ceramides: Lipids that function as the building blocks of the skin’s outer layers that are essential to water retention and hydration
Argan oil: Hydrating oil naturally rich in linoleic acid, which has been shown to help support healthy hair growth
Hyaluronic acid: Holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water for a boost in hydration











Beauty Tip:

Use the tip of the Double Duty Precision Liner to fill in any gaps in your lash line — the rich pigment will make your lashes look thicker instantly, while castor and argan oils help support healthy lash growth over time.

Omega-V Benefits® is composed of algae oil, a pure, non-fish, sustainable source of EPA and DHA. This bioavailable form can be easily absorbed for eye, heart, brain, and overall health benefits.*
 

Why it works

Contains essential nutrients, EPA and DHA,in a sustainable and easily absorbable form
Provides 330mg of EPA and 670mg of DHAfrom algae, NOT fish-based sources
Should be taken daily on a long-term basis to maximize ocular health
Tested for heavy metals, PCBs and dioxins
Offers the health benefits of omega-3s without the fishy aftertaste*

How it works

Studies show that daily intake of omega-3s (EPA &amp; DHA) promotes healthy tears for patients with occasional dry eyes, protects macular health before any signs of decline are visible, and supports and maintains retinal function and visual processing.*
 
Algae Oil is an excellent source of vegan omega-3s
Vegans and vegetarians have traditionally relied on plant-based omega-3s commonly found in sources like flaxseed oil. Unfortunately, these plant-based omega-3s are in the alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) form, which is not utilized by the human body in an efficient or beneficial way. In fact, studies show that ALA intake may even increase the risk of macular decline over time.1 Omega-V Benefits® is composed of algae oil, a pure, non-fish, sustainable source of EPA and DHA.

Two sets of cartridges (each set is good for 3-4 months of daily use or about 120 uses)



One microfiber bag for travel, storage and cleaning





Instructions:
 

To get the most out of your moisture release eyewear™, soak the cartridges in water for 30 seconds before placing them on each side; bend nose-bridge to create a seal around your eyes. You can also try to gently put Croakies (sport sunglass strap) in them if you don't get a perfect seal. Moisture will evaporate for a 3-4 hour period. After which, simply remove cartridges, re-moisten and insert back into frame for another 3-4 hours of relief.

Gently clean lenses as needed with the enclosed microfiber gray bag. If lenses or frames have dirt on them, rinse under warm water, air dry and clean with microfiber cloth. Do not use soap to clean lenses or rub lenses with cloth as it will reduce lifespan of the anti-fog coating. Pat any moisture dry with enclosed microfiber bag.



 


Aqueous Deficient Dry Eye, Sjögren's Syndrome


This syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by dry eyes and mouth. The immune system of people suffering from Sjögren’s Syndrome attacks the glands that keep these lubricated, but it also affects the whole body. About 4 million Americans have Sjögren’s Syndrome, and it’s more common in women. Symptoms include gritty or burning sensation in the eyes, dry mouth, lips, throat and eyes, difficulty talking, chewing or swallowing and joint pain.Treatment is symptomatic; dry eye caused by Sjögren’s Syndrome is often treated with warm compresses, artificial tears, punctual plugs, cyclosporine or corticosteroids.

Ocular Allergies


Ocular allergies are a reaction of the immune system to substances such as pollen or mold spores. The irritation of the conjunctiva causes puffy, itchy eyes. Ocular allergies are not just seasonal, as allergens can be indoors as well. Watery eyes, eye redness, swelling and pain are other common symptoms. Antihistamines, cold compresses and shielding your eyes from allergens by wearing glasses/sunglasses alleviate ocular allergies’ symptoms.

eyeeco-tranquileyes-mini-mask-and-gasket-only,Eyeeco Tranquileyes Mini (Mask and Gasket Only),"The patented tranquileyes® travel and sleep kit is designed to promote a relaxing, restful sleep, making it perfect for long flights, power naps, and your regular sleep patterns.
Padded with comfortable memory foam, they naturally shelter your eyes from drafts, dust, and low humidity environments, all contributors to dry eye and related conditions.
The goggle includes a set of removable moisture pads which can be soaked in hot water prior to sleep. This aids in the creation of moist-heat, key to soothing tired, irritated eyes. For migraines or puffiness, the pads can be frozen to create effective cold therapies, anytime you need them.
The goggle also creates total darkness, stimulating the pineal gland to release melatonin, a key promoter of deep sleep and relaxation. Whatever your dry eye problems, our travel and sleep kit can help, whether you're at home or on the road.
Included in the kit:


One standard size tranquileyes® goggle with foam
One mini stainless steel travel canister



Usage and Care
What is Tranquileyes used for?
In this context, Tranquileyes is used for overnight dry eye protection. 
Tranquileyes can also be used for moist heat therapy along with Thermoeyes heat inserts (purchased separately or in a moist heat therapy kit such as Tranquileyes Advanced). 
Instructions for use
Simply moisten the pads, place inside the goggle, and place over the eyes, adjusting the strap until comfortable. For cold therapies, freeze the moisture pads, then wear as normal.
Cleaning and care
Washing
Hand wash moisture pads (grey inserts) and/or thermopads (thin white foam inserts) with mild antibacterial soap and rinse thoroughly with hot water (shower temperature) before or after each use. Wash plastic eye covers and outer foam eye cushion as needed.
After rinsing, gently squeeze excess moisture out of pads and foam. Pat any excess moisture out of eye covers with a towel and hang to dry. All kits except the 'Mini' come with a net dry bag that you can use to hang your tranquileyes dry and keep clean.
Replacing Foam and Moisture Pads
Foam eye cushions should be replaced as needed, typically every two months if using daily. To replace, peel the old cushion away from the eyecup, one at a time. Peel liner off replacement foam, align each replacement cushion with the appropriate eyecup and press foam to eyecup. Dispose of all old foam (outer ring and inner moisture pads).

Why Organic?
Eye drops are systemically absorbed into the bloodstream, in varying degrees via their absorption through ocular tissues, the nasolacrimal tract and when swallowed. The eye drops we take can affect our bodies. With that in mind, the facts surrounding non-organic eye drop ingredients are compelling and raise a lot of questions.
Instead of a bunch of artificial chemicals in a bottle or vial, Eyeganics offers effective dry eye relief by using only three ingredients, without additives or preservatives: oil from organic vegetables, water, and salt. That's it. Eyeganics’ patent-pending eye drop formulation is certified organic by the USDA. Certified organic drops are guaranteed to have: no GMO’s, no synthetic chemicals, no impurities, and no artificial ingredients. Because, really, who wants any of that in their eyes and body?
Eyeganics is remarkably refreshing and extremely effective at relieving dry eye symptoms - BECAUSE of its organic purity and simplicity. While artificial chemicals and all of the other nonsense in conventional eye drops can provide temporary relief, the long-term effect may oftentimes be to make dry eye worse.
Continue reading about the chemicals used in non-organic eye drops.


Eyeganics Organic Tears is extremely refreshing for dry eyes, with only three ingredients: organic glycerin (oil from organic vegetables), salt, and water.


Eyeganics is the only eye drop that is certified organic by USDA: No preservatives, No artificial chemical ingredients, No additives. Soy and Gluten Free.


New technology dispenses ~250 preservative-free drops per bottle - an excellent value compared to single-use vials. Note: Our bottle dropper is easy to use, requiring a sustained, steady squeeze to dispense drops.

Visual Benefits



After taking EyePromise Restore for about 3 months, your eyes will have superpowers! Well, not really, but here are some very real changes* you may notice in your vision:



Visual acuity: you may find yourself seeing details easier or being able to read certain signs from further away than before.






Contrast sensitivity: you may notice you can more easily discern that the dark figure in the distance is one of those metal statues rather than a real person during the evening.






Light and glare sensitivity: you may notice you’re driving at night with more confidence and the bright headlights are causing you fewer problems.






Vision in low light: you may notice that it’s easier for you to read the menu in that restaurant with the unusually dark mood lighting.





Improved occasional dryness and irritation: you may notice your eyes feeling less dried out and irritated throughout the day.






What's In Restore?








We believe in transparency, what you see is what you get.

ZeaxanthinThe most critical nutrient needed for vision support and improvement. Zeaxanthin acts as “internal sunglasses” for vision by building the eye's natural protection from harmful blue light and other damaging elements called oxidants. This nutrient is scarce in the typical American diet.*




LuteinThis nutrient works with zeaxanthin in supporting and improving vision.*

Fortifeye’s Advanced Retina Formula prompted by the National Eye Institute (NEI) Age Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2): the nutritional supplement called AREDS2 formulation can reduce the risk of developing advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD). if you are high risk for developing AMD, you should consider taking the antioxidant zinc combinations in AREDS2.

Fortifeye AREDSII PLUS (new name is Advanced Retina Formula) is made without the use of synthetic dyes and
 contains natural vitamin E, uses a more bio-available safer level of zinc and has utilized two super nutrients Astaxanthin and Resveratrol.
These two nutrients are potent antioxidants and powerful anti-inflammatories.

Many studies have validated the positive benefits these nutrients obtain for both Total body wellness and Ocular health.  All of these nutrients are in a non-dye vegetable capsule.  Fortifeye has once again provided the latest evidence-based nutrients for you.  Optometrists and Ophthalmologists all over the world are recommending Fortifeye AREDS II plus (Advanced Retina Formula) to their patients.
After careful evaluation of the science and a significant amount of DNA clinical analysis with macular degeneration patients the Fortifeye Doctors decided it was in the best interest of patients / customers to use less zinc (30mg) in this new formulation. The Fortifeye Vitamin team also recommends that all macular degeneration patients eat a diet consistent with the Lange Survival Diet or Fortifeye Survival Diet.  Here is a link to the diet:  The Lange Survival Diet – Dr. Michael Lange (drmichaellange.com)

Fortifeye FOCUS was developed for reviving, rejuvenating, refreshing and protecting your eyes. It is used to give the nutrients studies show may help reduce eye fatigue and strain from prolonged near-work and computer work. Also specific ratios of carotenoids are used to protect the eye from the harmful blue light emitted from computer, tablets, smart phones, television, sun light and new forms of indoor lighting.
Fortifeye FOCUS is a combination of the following three carotenoids: Astaxanthin, Lutein, and Zeaxanthin isomers.













Fortifeye FOCUS is a combination of the following three carotenoids:

Astaxanthin
Lutein
Zeaxanthin isomers

This new formulation was developed to deliver specific nutrients, clinical studies have shown may help reduce accommodative stress and filter the harmful blue light associated with prolonged work on computers and other digital apps. Fortifeye FOCUS is recommended for individuals at any age who work on a computer or other digital applications for any extended period of time. Clinical studies indicate that 6mg of astaxanthin reduces eye fatigue symptomology and actually improves amplitude of accommodation, the eye’s ability to focus clearly on objects at near distances. Many symptoms associated with eye fatigue including tired eyes, sore eyes and dry eyes were dramatically reduced in less than four weeks in clinical studies using 6mg of astaxanthin a day. Studies also indicate astaxanthin may support  circulation and reduce inflammation in the eye. Fortifeye FOCUS is an exciting new nutritional approach to aid the millions of people suffering from eye fatigue while working with tasks at near focus. Fortifeye FOCUS can be used alone or in combination with any of the Fortifeye Vitamins.† 1000s of people world wide have been taking Fortifeye Focus and testify to the positive benefits. One of the newest areas of exciting research is on the damaging effects that (HIV) blue light has on our eyes and our entire body. We are now in the Digital Era and all of the digital pieces of technology we use emitt potentially damaging waves of blue light. New science is proving that prolonged exposure to blue light may increase ones risk of developing macular degeneration. Blue light exposure especially in the evening may actually “trick” the brain into thinking you are actually outside in the sunlight and therefore supress the production of melatonin. When melatonin levels drop , sleep problems may arise along with many other potential health problems. The carotenoids in Fortifeye Focus have the ability to filter a portion of this harmful blue light and help to combat against free radical damage and inflammation. . Doctors all over the world are recommending Fortifeye focus for its many benefits. The same ratios of lutein and Zeaxanthin isomers use in LAMA 1 and Lama 2 studies are used in Fortifeye Focus.  Fortifeye Focus is the first in the industry to take the benefits of Lutein, Zeaxanthin Isomers and Astaxanthin and put into a fish gelatin non gmo olive oil delivery system.
Astaxanthin – A relatively new nutrient used in supplements that comes from microalga Haematococcus pluvialis, astaxanthin is proving to have multiple health benefits. The carotenoid astaxanthin is the reason lobsters, shrimp and some crabs turn red when cooked. While it constitutes a tiny portion of farm-raised salmon feed (50 to 100 parts per million), astaxanthin represents up to 20 percent of the cost. Astaxanthin is an extremely potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Clinical studies have now proven that 6mg of astaxanthin can support the blood flow to the eye and actually aid in accommodation (focusing) and in reducing eye fatigue. Astaxanthin reduces inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein (CRP), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Astaxanthin is documented with high potencies for neutralizing oxygen radicals. For example, it is 550 times more powerful than vitamin E or 40 times more powerful than beta-carotene against singlet oxygen radicals. These remarkable aspects of astaxanthin are why Fortifeye Vitamins has incorporated it into their new eye vitamin formulas.  Studies also indicate that astaxanthin may help in muscle recovery and reduce muscle fatigue. Many patients that have been taking supplemental astaxanthin have also noticed the sun block properties this powerful antioxidant exhibits. Astaxanthin has also been linked to healthier skin and less fine lines and wrinkles have been documented after taking astaxanthin for a few months. Astaxanthin in a truly unique nutrient with some incredible health benefits. Learn more about production of our astaxanthin.
Lutein – A carotenoid found naturally in dark green leafy vegetables (spinach and kale) and other natural sources, this potent antioxidant is sorely lacking in the typical American diet. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the only carotenoids found in the retina of the eye. Lutein supplementation has been shown in landmark clinical studies to increase macular pigment density which may promote macular health. Scientists believe lutein helps filter out dangerous ‘blue’ light, helping to maintain the photoreceptor and retinal health. Lutein is now believed to have a protective effect on the retina. In the AREDS 2 trial, study participants on an AREDS formulation containing lutein/zeaxanthin (no beta-carotene) had an 18 percent lower risk of progressing to advanced AMD compared with those who took AREDS original formula containing beta-carotene and no lutein/zeaxanthin. Lutein may also have some protective effects against cataract formation. † The LAMA 1 and LAMA2 study published in 2016 proves that supplementing with a specific type and ratio of Lutein and Zeaxanthin Isomers May support retinal health along with other potential health benefits.  Fortifeye Focus is using this exact ratio of Lutemax 20/20 along with the amazing health benefits of 6mg of astaxanthin. Lutein and the 2 zeaxanthin isomers: RR zeaxanthin and RS (MESO)-zeaxanthin are the only 3 carotenoids in the macula. Increased dietary intake of these 3 carotenoids is associated with an increase in the macular pigment density of the retina. This increase in macular pigment density reduces oxidative stress to the macular and may prove to Be beneficial to macular health.
 Zeaxanthin – Zeaxanthin is one of the two carotenoids contained within the retina of the eye. Zeaxanthin and lutein have an almost identical chemical structure and have similar properties. Zeaxanthin, like lutein, increases macular pigment density and also helps to filter out the harmful blue light from the sun. Gogi berries have one of the highest sources of zeaxanthin and orange bell peppers are relatively high in zeaxanthin and more readily available. Zeaxanthin and its related compound lutein are highly concentrated in the macula, providing a yellow color known as the macular pigment (MP). The macular pigment acts like a built in sunscreen and protects the macula from the damaging photo-oxidative effects of blue light.† The AREDS 2 trial proved that the arm of the study that had Lutein / Zeaxanthin and no beta carotene were less likely to go to a more advanced stage of macular degeneration. LAMA 1 and LAMA2 study published in 2016 proves that supplementing with Lutein and Zeaxanthin Isomers (both RR and RS(meso)) in a specific structure and ratio had some positive ocular and overall health benefits. Fortifeye Focus is using this exact ratio of Lutemax 20/20 combined with Astaxanthin.  Fortifeye Focus has evolved into one of the supplements of choice for gamers. Gaming has become quite popular and creates a stressful environment for the eyes.  This constant exposure to blue light may increase the risk of blue light damage to the retina.  Anyone in front of a computer for prolonged periods of times like gamers should be proactive and take a supplement containing lutein, zeaxanthin isomers and astaxanthin.  These nutrients may enhance performance while protecting the eyes too.
Fortifeye has chosen AstaREAL® astaxanthin – The Astaxanthin of Choice and Omni Actives Lutemax 20/20 for the Lutein and Zeaxanthin Isomers. AstaREAL® astaxanthin is manufactured by Fuji Chemical Industry from Haematococcus pluvialis microalgae and is cultivated in systems in Washington state and in state-of-the-art photobioreactors in environmentally friendly Gustavsberg, Sweden. AstaREAL® astaxanthin products are guaranteed for high potency, quality and stability. AstaReal is the only natural astaxanthin certified Paleo and Keto by the Paleo Foundation. Fuji’s enclosed mass-culture systems generate the highest quality, purity and consistency of astaxanthin in the world. There is a growing interest in the power of astaxanthin among researchers with athletes. So far, the research on astaxanthin shows impressive results for muscle health recovery and endurance, due to its ability to protect cells and membranes from oxidative damage. The results indicate that AstaReal®, with natural astaxanthin, improves muscle endurance and lowers lactic acid by improving fat utilization, mitochondrial function and by reducing oxidation of red blood cells and muscle damage. In addition, studies demonstrate that astaxanthin decreases inflammation, which may reduce muscle pain and potentially prevent muscle atrophy. The effects of astaxanthin have wide appeal as we recognize more and more the importance of healthy and strong muscles in achieving an active lifestyle and a good quality of life.
Omni Actives is one of the world leaders in the production of lutein and zeaxanthin isomers from start to finish. They plant the seeds, grow the plant, harvest and produce the lutein and zeaxanthin isomers for supplement use. Their vision statement is “we improve lives by enhancing nutrition and wellness using science and innovation”. Omni Actives is involved in many nutritional studies using their ratios of lutemax 20/20.

Increased dietary intake of these 3 carotenoids is associated with an increase in the macular pigment density of the retina. This increase in macular pigment density reduces oxidative stress to the macular and may prove to Be beneficial to macular health.
 Zeaxanthin– Zeaxanthin is one of the two carotenoids contained within the retina of the eye. Zeaxanthin and lutein have an almost identical chemical structure and have similar properties. Zeaxanthin, like lutein, increases macular pigment density and also helps to filter out the harmful blue light from the sun. Gogi berries have one of the highest sources of zeaxanthin and orange bell peppers are relatively high in zeaxanthin and more readily available. Zeaxanthin and its related compound lutein are highly concentrated in the macula, providing a yellow color known as the macular pigment (MP). The macular pigment acts like a built in sunscreen and protects the macula from the damaging photo-oxidative effects of blue light.† The AREDS 2 trial proved that the arm of the study that had Lutein / Zeaxanthin and no beta carotene were less likely to go to a more advanced stage of macular degeneration. LAMA 1 and LAMA2 study published in 2016 proves that supplementing with Lutein and Zeaxanthin Isomers (both RR and RS(meso)) in a specific structure and ratio had some positive ocular and overall health benefits. Fortifeye Focus is using this exact ratio of Lutemax 20/20 combined with Astaxanthin. Fortifeye Focus has evolved into one of the supplements of choice for gamers. Gaming has become quite popular and creates a stressful environment for the eyes. This constant exposure to blue light may increase the risk of blue light damage to the retina. Anyone in front of a computer for prolonged periods of times like gamers should be proactive and take a supplement containing lutein, zeaxanthin isomers and astaxanthin. These nutrients may enhance performance while protecting the eyes too.
Fortifeyehas chosen AstaREAL® astaxanthin – The Astaxanthin of Choice and Omni Actives Lutemax 20/20 for the Lutein and Zeaxanthin Isomers. AstaREAL® astaxanthin is manufactured by Fuji Chemical Industry from Haematococcus pluvialis microalgae and is cultivated in systems in Washington state and in state-of-the-art photobioreactors in environmentally friendly Gustavsberg, Sweden. AstaREAL® astaxanthin products are guaranteed for high potency, quality and stability. AstaReal is the only natural astaxanthin certified Paleo and Keto by the Paleo Foundation. Fuji’s enclosed mass-culture systems generate the highest quality, purity and consistency of astaxanthin in the world. There is a growing interest in the power of astaxanthin among researchers with athletes. So far, the research on astaxanthin shows impressive results for muscle health recovery and endurance, due to its ability to protect cells and membranes from oxidative damage. The results indicate that AstaReal®, with natural astaxanthin, improves muscle endurance and lowers lactic acid by improving fat utilization, mitochondrial function and by reducing oxidation of red blood cells and muscle damage. In addition, studies demonstrate that astaxanthin decreases inflammation, which may reduce muscle pain and potentially prevent muscle atrophy. The effects of astaxanthin have wide appeal as we recognize more and more the importance of healthy and strong muscles in achieving an active lifestyle and a good quality of life.
Omni Actives is one of the world leaders in the production of lutein and zeaxanthin isomers from start to finish. They plant the seeds, grow the plant, harvest and produce the lutein and zeaxanthin isomers for supplement use. Their vision statement is “we improve lives by enhancing nutrition and wellness using science and innovation”. Omni Actives is involved in many nutritional studies using their ratios of lutemax 20/20.

Fortifeye Next Gen Complete is the very latest in evidence-based nutritional support for total body wellness and ocular health. Fortifeye Vitamins has taken all of the most recent clinical nutritional studies and combined this nutritional science into one of the most advanced multivitamin / eye vitamins available today. Fortifeye changed its current Fortifeye Complete dramatically into this new generation multivitamin. The Next Gen Complete is now in an easy to swallow vegie capsule. Fortifeye Next Gen Complete is a cost-effective Nutraceutical bringing the very latest in nutrition for total body wellness and vision support. Thousands of patients throughout the world are taking the Fortifeye Vitamins with great results.










Fortifeye® Next Gen Complete is a synergistic blend of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients and carotenoids. This formula is in an easy to swallow veggie capsule without the use of any dyes.
These are nutraceuticals developed to aid in total body wellness, a healthy immune system and vision support. Fortifeye Next Gen Complete is in one convenient capsule that is taken twice daily with meals. This supplement is made in an NSF certified and FDA inspected facility. USP certified ingredients are used in this formulation. This unique formula is based on the latest science and is currently being used by thousands of people throughout the world. Fortifeye Next Gen Complete has evolved to its current nutrient profile after almost 2 decades of research and 12 reformulations. This final formula was reached after years of clinical use with patients in large eyecare centers combined with serum and intracellular blood testing and retesting.
Some of the latest evidence-based nutrients for visual support and total body health used in this new formula are: B Complex, 8 forms of Vitamin E, D3, C, Zinc, Saffron, resveratrol, pine bark extract, black currant fruit extract, lutein, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, grape seed extract, coenzyme Q10, taurine, acetyl l carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, bilberry and curcumin from the turmeric root. These nutrients exhibit powerful antioxidants and anti -inflammatory effects that may also help inhibit the formation of “bad” blood vessels (anti-VEGF). Clinically studied levels of the most bio-available forms of Vitamin, D, E, C, B, zinc and chromium have also been added to this new formula. This may prove to be helpful in macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, other eye and systemic diseases.
B Complex In a 7-year cardiovascular disease trial involving more than 5,200 women, folic acid, B-6 and B-12 was given daily to half the subjects and the other half were given a placebo. The group who received the vitamins ended up with a 41% decrease in the incidence of macular degeneration. This is a significant finding for macular degeneration patients and children of the macular degeneration patients. More research is needed; however, it may be useful to consume B complex to aid in prevention and support the retina and total body. Studies also indicate B12 may have some protective benefits against cataracts, glaucoma, and optic neuropathy. Low levels of B12 are associated with memory problems, dementia and Alzheimer’s. B12, Folic Acid and B6 are used to lower homocysteine which can reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Lutein and Zeaxanthin isomers in a new micro beadlet delivery system are in this formula to help replenish the macula pigment density, filter out the dangerous blue light and also act as a powerful antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Current science indicates that macula density progressively decreases as macular degeneration progresses. Lutein/Zeaxanthin are proving to be beneficial for both macular degeneration and and possibly cataracts. Studies of these carotenoids are proving to be beneficial for the skin and the brain.

Acetyl L Carnatine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Astaxanthin and Co Q 10 were added to support mitochondria health that are the organelles responsible for increase ATP (energy) production and aid in neuro protection. All eight forms of vitamin E (four tocopherols and four tocotrienols) are utilized in this formula to maximize free radical quenching. A very bio available form of Zinc is used to increase absorption.

Resveratrolis a powerful polyphenol that has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects found in red wine. The “French Parodox” links the French people that have a diet very high in saturated fats to less heat disease and deaths than Americans because of the protective effects of the resveratrol in the red wine they drink. Resveratrol appears to be linked to longer lifespans and healthy aging. Many studies have shown that resveratrol may have some benefits for certain cancers, joint pain and heart disease. New studies indicate resveratrol may have a positive impact on macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Fortifeye was one of the first in the industry to use resveratrol in their supplements.

Astaxanthin has been added for its amazing free radical quenching and anti-inflammatory abilities. Astaxanthin is 550 times more potent at quenching free radicals than vitamins c.
Astaxanthin is found in the ciliary body of the eye and is associated with less eye strain and improved accommodation. Studies also indicate astaxanthin improves choroidal circulation. Astaxanthin has multiple studies indicating it may minimize fine lines and wrinkles in the face and improve muscle endurance and muscle recovery. Astaxanthin is what give wild Alaskan salmon the red color.

Saffronthe most expensive spice in the world has been added to this formula for its amazing overall health and ocular health benefits. Recent clinical studies have shown that saffron improved visual acuity by two lines in patients with macular degeneration and also some improvement in ERG (electro retinogram). Saffron contains 4 all-star antioxidants: crocin, crocetin, safranal and kaempferol. Past and ongoing clinical studies have linked saffron to antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, weight reduction and many more health benefits. Saffron seems to be an extremely safe ingredient with lots of potential health benefits.

Black Currant Fruit Extract has clinical studies supporting improved blood flow to the eye, reduction in dry eye symptoms, improvement in dark adaptation and may slow the progression of visual field loss in glaucoma. Black Currant Fruit extract has studies supporting benefits for the heart, joints, skin and immune system.

Pine bark extract is another new ingredient in Fortifeye Next Gen Complete. Pine Bark Extract is high in 3 polyphenols: Procyanidins, Catechins and Phenolic Acids. These compounds exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. a specific ratio of pine bark extract when combined with bilberry has been shown to lower intra ocular pressure in patients with glaucoma clinically. Another study suggests that diabetics that take pine bark extract with the early stages of diabetic retinopathy may enhance retinal circulation and lower retinal edema minimizing the potential devastating effects of diabetic retinopathy. Pine bark extract is being investigated in studies including Alzheimer’s, skin health, athletic performance, improvement in cognitive abilities, ADHD, ED, osteoarthritis, bone loss, certain auto immune conditions and much more. Pine bark extract is a promising nutrient to be utilized in a supplement to support healthy aging.

Bilberry or European blueberry contains powerful antioxidants called anthocyanins. Bilberry acts as both an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory. Fighter pilots used to eat bilberry jam because they claimed to improve their night vision. Many patients report less eye fatigue and less dry eye symptoms while working on digital screens while taking bilberry. Studies have shown bilberry supports healthy retina, improved contrast sensitivity and improved tear secretion. Studies also indicate bilberry may reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s and digestive issues. Bilberry when combined with pine bark extract has been shown clinically to lower intraocular pressure in patients. Bilberry is another great addition to the Fortifeye Next Gen Complete multivitamin.

Grape seed extract is rich in anthocyanins, flavonoids and oligomeric proanthocyanins (OPCs). These help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Studies indicate grape seed extract may benefit the heart, eyes, kidney, brain, liver, immune system and skin. Grape seed extract studies show may have some protective effect against cataracts and is being studied for retinal health.

Taurine is an amino acid concentrated in your eyes, brain, muscles and heart. It is crucial for the support of the central nervous system, immune system and the eyes. Taurine acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. It has also been shown to enhance energy and improve exercise performance. Studies also indicate taurine may have some benefits for the eye, heart, hearing , brain and the liver.
Vitamin A deficiencies are very rare in developed countries and too much Vitamin A poses some serious health risks while beta carotene has been linked to lung cancer in smokers.
Studies now indicate that beta carotene may block the absorption of Lutein, Zeaxanthin and Astaxanthin as a result Fortifeye has removed Vitamin A and beta carotene. Many other nutrients are used in this comprehensive formula in precise ratios to aid in maximum cellular absorption.Fortifeye Next Gen Complete can be used alone or in combination with Fortifeye Super Omega-3, or Fortifeye Focus to combat against free radical damage in the eyes and body.
When Fortifeye Vitamins are combined with lifestyle changes and dietary modifications significant improvements in the health of the eyes and body can be a result. Fortifeye Next Gen Complete is recommended to anyone wanting to be pro-active in their future health.
Fortifeye Next Gen Complete has been developed to deliver complete nutritional support for total body and eye health. Specific nutrients in precise ratios have been used to give nutritional support to the retina, optic nerve, cornea and lens. These nutrients may also aid in neuro protection, cardio protection, circulation, skin health, joint health and cellular health.
Fortifeye’s goal with Fortifeye Next Gen Complete: To bring the very latest in nutritional support to the eyes and entire body. Fortifeye Next Gen Complete is an evolution in nutritional science. This supplement will continue to evolve as new science becomes available. Support for Nutritional anti-aging is here.

fortifeye-next-gen-macular-defense-eye-and-whole-body-support-90ct-3-month-supply,Fortifeye Next Gen Macular Defense Eye and Whole Body Support (90ct - 3 Month Supply),"The most potent addition to the Fortifeye line of science-based Nutraceuticals is Fortifeye Macular Defense. This Nutraceutical has been in development stage for many years. A multitude of intracellular and plasma blood tests were used in clinical settings with macular degeneration patients to determine what would be optimal for this formula. Fortifeye Macular Defense has taken the latest in nutritional science to create formulas to aid in the defense against free radical damage in the eye and body.
This formula was created to minimize nutritional deficiencies and maximize the total antioxidant function at a cellular level. Fortifeye has increased the ORAC value (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) to over 33% higher than Fortifeye Complete. This is the same exact formula as Fortifeye Complete However, it is 33% stronger calling for 3 tablets daily. Fortifeye Macular Defense has higher levels of the specific nutrients that have been studied extensively by Fortifeye. 33% higher levels of all the nutrients listed in the Fortifeye Complete have been added to the Fortifeye Macular Defense making it one of the strongest antioxidants available from Fortifeye.
This formula was developed initially for the macular degeneration patient but is now being used extensively throughout the world for extreme athletes, immune deficiencies, smokers, heavy drinkers, overweight patients, patients on medications that can block antioxidant uptake, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy patients. FortifeyeMacular Defense was developed to aid patients that are in need of higher dosages of specific time-tested nutrients.
These vitamins should be taken in three divided dosages with food to maximize absorption.
Fortifeye Macular Defense can be taken alone or with Fortifeye Super Omega, or Fortifeye Focus. Fortifeye Vitamin formulas have helped many patients to maintain their independence and in certain cases regain their independence thru better vision and/or better health-giving hope thru proper nutrition. Specific nutrients known to have high ORAC values were used to increase the overall ORAC value in this supplement. Increasing total ORAC score will aid in the reduction of free radical damage and oxidative stress in the body and eye. Studies now indicate that decreasing the oxidative stress in the body may aid in prevention or slow down the degenerative diseases in the body and eye.
Ongoing in-house clinical studies using the latest in intracellular and plasma blood testing will continue be used to further enhance the Fortifeye line of Nutraceuticals. Current nutritional science recommends eating 10-12 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. This can be a very difficult task in today’s busy environment. The Fortifeye Macular Defense can help individuals gain some of the antioxidants they may not be getting in their diet. Many changes in this new formula have been made to maximize absorption. Many new nutrients have been added, many current nutrients have been either increased, decreased or molecular structure changed to aid in absorption.
Fortifeye Vitamins are developed to deliver complete nutritional support for total body and eye health. Specific nutrients in precise ratios have been used to give nutritional support to the eye.  These nutrients may also give Nutritional support to the entire body.  Fortifeye Vitamins when combined with proper diet, hydration, sleep and exercise promotes healthy aging from the inside out.
Fortifeye’s goal with Fortifeye Macular Defense was to develop a science based all in one supplement. Patients would not have to have numerous bottles and boxes scattered about and be concerned about sterility, cost and compliance. Fortifeye Macular Defense is a cost effective Nutraceutical bringing the very latest in nutrition for total body wellness and vision support. Fortifeye Macular Defense is a more powerful version of Fortifeye Complete with higher levels of specific nutrients to aid in retinal health especially in the macular degenerative patient. Thousands of patients throughout the world are taking the Fortifeye Vitamins with great results. Whether you are a young or old Fortifeye may be right for you! Maybe its time to try the supplements being recommended by Optometrists and Ophthalmologists all over the globe.
Fortifeye Macular Defense is based on all of the latest nutritional science and research for macular degeneration.  There are specific reasons the formula has the exact nutrients and ratios.  Example: there is no beta carotene in this formula because it blocks the absorption of beneficial carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin.  Macular degeneration patients need these valuable carotenoids to promote and protect macular health.  The Fortifeye Vitamin team of doctors recommends taking these supplements with food however no multi vitamins, carrots or sweet potatoes should be consumed for a few hrs  before or after these vitamins.  These specific foods are very high in beta carotene and may block the absorption of the eye healthy carotenoids.",Fortifeye,Dry Eye Products,Supplements,TRUE,Title,Default Title,DER8901,56.95,TRUE,TRUE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mobo4/dryeyela-hydrogen/main/public/products_processed/fortifeye-next-gen-macular-defense-eye-and-whole-body-support-90ct-3-month-supply.png,1,Fortifeye Next Gen Macular Defense Eye and Whole Body Support (90ct - 3 Month Supply),FALSE,Fortifeye Next Gen Macular Defense Eye and Whole Body Support (90ct - 3 Month Supply) | Eye Care Center OC,Fortifeye Next Gen Macular Defense Eye and Whole Body Support (90ct - 3 Month Supply),active,continue,shopify,manual,
fortifeye-softgels-for-dry-eye-relief-gla-epa-and-dha-30ct-1-month-supply,Fortifeye Black Currant Seed oil-GLA,"Black Currant oil is very high in an essential fatty acid called GLA (gamma-linolenic acid). GLA is very difficult to get in the typical diet. GLA is a natural anti-inflammatory that also promotes healthy skin, hair and nails.  Black Currant oil is also high in Alpha Linolenic Acid (ALA) a plant-based omega 3. Fortifeye Black Currant Oil has 140mg of GLA in each gel cap!
There is science-based evidence that GLA a derivative of Omega 6 has potential positive benefits for the dry eye patient. Many large dry eye centers have used 140mg of GLA combined with rTG form Omega 3 with great success in their dry eye clinics.
The typical Standard American Diet (SAD) is a pro inflammatory diet that creates many health issues among our population. It is too high in omega 6 fatty acids and too low in omega 3 fatty acids thus creating inflammation in our bodies and eyes.  The SAD diet is filled with processed sugar, saturated fats and highly refined carbohydrates.   The team at Fortifeye Vitamins recommends everyone adjusting their diets to an anti-inflammatory diet like the Lange Survival Diet to quell the inflammation in the eyes and entire body. Here is a link to this diet :  https://www.drmichaellange.com/blog/the-lange-survival-diet/
Not all omega 6 fatty acids are created equal.  Linoleic acid and Arachidonic Acid are pro inflammatory and GLA is anti-inflammatory.  However, it is very difficult to get the required amount of GLA in our typical American Diet so supplementing with a good GLA supplement is a great benefit.
The body converts GLA to Dihomo gamma linolenic acid (DGLA) that is a precursor of the anti-inflammatory Prostaglandin PGE1.  PGE1 supports the production of a healthy tear film.
Studies indicate that GLA works synergistically with EPA from Omega 3 fish oil to further enhance the anti-inflammatory effects.   The Omega 3 helps to block the inflammatory effects of arachidonic acid as it converts to pro inflammatory prostaglandin PGE2.  The combination of a good Omega 3 like Fortifeye Super Omega or Fortifeye Super Omega 3 Max with Fortifeye Black Currant Oil/ GLA really helps to reduce inflammation in the eyes and entire body naturally. This combination is being recommended and used by doctors around the world.  Fortifeye Advanced Dry Eye Therapy has taken all of this science and combined it into one complete supplement.  https://fortifeye.com/product/new-improved-advanced-dry-eye-therapy/",Fortifeye,Dry Eye Products,Supplements,TRUE,Title,Default Title,DER8885,24.95,TRUE,TRUE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mobo4/dryeyela-hydrogen/main/public/products_processed/fortifeye-softgels-for-dry-eye-relief-gla-epa-and-dha-30ct-1-month-supply.png,1,Fortifeye Black Currant Seed oil-GLA,FALSE,Fortifeye Black Currant Seed oil-GLA | Eye Care Center OC,Fortifeye Black Currant Seed oil-GLA,active,continue,shopify,manual,

Using products with too many harsh chemicals can wreak havoc on the skin around your eyes, causing redness, irritation, and inflammation. Heyedrate's Eye Cream and Face Moisturizer hydrates the skin without the use of chemicals or harsh ingredients -- so you can get back to the life you love.

STOP Using Retinol Around Your Eyes! Studies show that exposing your eyelids to retinol inhibits cell proliferation, increases cell atrophy, alters gene expression, changes signaling pathways, and promotes inflammatory mediator and protease expression in meibomian gland epithelial cells. What Does This Mean? It is killing the glands in your eyelids!


While We Are On The Subject, STOP Using Phenoxyethanol! Phenoxyethanol is a common preservative used in organic eye creams, but a recent study demonstrated that this may affect your eyelids the same way that retinol does. Check your creams and get rid of phenoxyethanol and retinol. Save your eyelids!


Developed by Optometrists and Made For Your Eyelids - Our Proprietary Formula is91.243% Organic with ingredients that you'll love, like organic aloe juice, sweet almond oil, shea butter, and green tea leaf extract.
Non-Greasy - Sweet almond oil easily absorbs into the skin, leaving a less greasy feel than other leading brands. Did you know that most brands add chemicals to make their lotion and eye cream feel more moisturizing, but it really isn't?


Gentle on All Skin Types and the Delicate Skin of Your Eyelids - Free of artificial fragrance, hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic, non-irritating, and 91.243% organic, which makes this eye cream and face moisturizer great for all skin types from oily to dry to sensitive skin.


DIRECTIONS:
Apply to face, eyelids, and neck, morning and evening, to give your skin that TLC it deserves. For extra care, use this cream after washing your face with Heyedrate Tea Tree Foaming Face Wash and cleansing your eyelids with Heyedrate Lid and Lash Cleanser.

Containing 0.40% sodium hyaluronate, I-DEFENCE’s formulation is extremely effective at providing maximum, long-lasting relief of dry eye symptoms and is well tolerated by the patient.
The unique viscous properties of I-DEFENCE enable a prolonged contact-time with the ocular surface. This hydrating ointment provides soothing relief of dry eye symptoms, such as soreness, irritation or a gritty sensation on the eyes and acts as a barrier against moisture loss. It can be used during surgical procedures and is ideal for patients that suffer from nocturnal lagophthalmos.
I-DEFENCE is recommended for night-time use. Upon application, the patient may experience a foreign body sensation that will pass after several blinks. If used during the day, it is recommended that the patient does not drive a car or operate heavy machinery, as their vision may be blurry due to the consistency of the ointment. I-DEFENCE® is most effective when used at night while the patient is asleep, which allows the ointment to remain on the cornea longer.
Do not use I-DEFENCE with contact lenses.

Just a single drop of LASTACAFT in each eye once per day relieves itchy eyes due to allergies in as little as 3 minutes and lasts all day long (through 16 hours).
So how does LASTACAFT work?
When allergens in the air come into contact with your eyes, histamine is released which is the bodys natural defense mechanism that causes an allergic response which can make your eyes itch.
Only LASTACAFTs patented, prescription-strength formula contains the active ingredient Alcaftadine 0.25%, an ophthalmic antihistamine that relieves eye itching from allergies also known as allergic conjunctivitis.
Just one drop of LASTACAFT relieves itchy allergy eyes by 1) blocking histamine H1 receptors and 2) preventing further release of more histamine in the eye. LASTACAFT works in minutes against both seasonal and year-round allergens which include pollen, grass, ragweed, animal hair, and pet dander so that youre covered indoors and outdoors throughout the day. Unlike oral antihistamine allergy medications, LASTACAFT is applied directly to the eye, relieving eye itchiness in just 3 minutes. 
LASTACAFT is tough on allergies, while being easy on the eyes. It can be used in adults and can be given to children as young as 2 years of age. LASTACAFT Once Daily Relief Antihistamine Eye Drops also provide great value.

Take 4 Softgels daily, preferably with a meal.
Based on the AREDS2* study MacuHealth PLUS+ is specifically formulated by eye health experts for those patients already diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration. AREDS2* was published in 2013. Here is what they found:

AREDS2 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 9% in risk of disease progression to advanced AMD for patients receiving two of the three macular carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) when compared with patients not receiving these antioxidants.
The reduction in concentration of zinc from 80mg to 25mg (as found in MacuHealth PLUS+) did not have an adverse effect on the desirable and observed reduced risk of progression to advanced AMD.

MacuHealth PLUS+ = AREDS2* formulation, with two important distinctions:

Reduced Zinc from 80mg to 25mg, thereby compliant with RDA (recommended dietary allowance) and therefore precluding the possibility of any increased risk for disease progression in AMD patients with a particular genetic background. Of note, AREDS2* has shown that there was no significant difference between the AMD group who received 25mg of zinc compared to the AMD group who received 80mg of zinc (in terms of benefits), supporting further the decision to recommend a lower (25mg) zinc dose for patients with AMD.
The addition of 10mg of Meso-Zeaxanthin (the third and centrally dominant macular carotenoid), thereby facilitating maximum augmentation of macular pigment and facilitating optimization of visual performance in eyes with AMD.The evidence base for supplementation in patients with AMD favors an AREDS2* formulation, but without dangerous levels of Zinc, and using a supplement that contains all three macular carotenoids in a MZ:L:Z (mg) ratio of 10:10:2. The only such commercially available supplement is MacuHealth PLUS+.

MacuHealth nourishes and replenishes the macular pigment so patients can maintain a lifetime of retinal health. Containing all three critical carotenoids in a patented 10:10:2 ratio consisting of Lutein (10mg), Meso-Zeaxanthin (10mg), and Zeaxanthin (2mg), MacuHealth is clinically proven to quickly and effectively optimize macular pigment.
Now with patented Micro-Micelle™ Technology, MacuHealth delivers statistically significant increases in carotenoid concentrations and the highest level of bioavailability studied to date.
Learn How LMZ From MacuHealth Can Benefit You
Peer-reviewed research shows MacuHealth’s proven effectiveness to replenish macular pigment. With continuous supplementation, MacuHealth improves visual performance by increasing contrast sensitivity, reducing glare and protecting eyes from harmful blue light.
Additionally, by increasing your macular pigment production, MacuHealth reduces oxidative stress and injury that free radicals from UV or blue light cause to your eyes. With this added protection, your eye’s cells are safeguarded from damage and your risk for eye diseases later in life is reduced.

What it is:  TheNanodropper is the only FDA-listed, volume-reducing adaptor for eyedrop bottles. By simply twisting the Nanodropper onto a compatible bottle, you can reduce thedrop-size by over 60%, allowing your bottle to last about 3 times as long. Smaller drops have been shown to reduce waste, cost, and side effects.
Nanodropper does not fit all bottles, scrolls down for important compatibility information 
Use one Nanodropper per bottle. Do not transfer or reuse on subsequent bottles. Dispose of your bottle when recommended by your eyecare professional. Nanodroppermay not be used with some treatment plans, always consult your eyecare professional before using the Nanodropper.
Traditional Eye Drops
Nanodropper was made for multi-dose eyedrop bottles that have a screw-top cap like those in the picture below. While the volume of the bottle does not matter, the diameter of the threads that the cap goes onto is very important. Most bottle threads will have an “imperial” diameter of approximately 9/16in (0.5625in or ~15mm). These are the bottles that Nanodropper is compatible with. There are a few bottles that have a “metric” diameter of 14mm (~0.55in), 13mm (~0.5in), or smaller. These smaller sizes will be coming soon!
Does It Fit?
Do not assume your bottle is compatible just from this image, many bottles look the same but will be different sizes.
You can test if your bottle will fit our current-sized adaptor using the Compatibility Guide linked in the button below. You will find a print-out guide that will allow you to measure your bottle as shown in the image. If you do not have a printer, there is an alternative option on the guide as well.

Please note that the same type of medication is sometimes packaged in different types of bottles. You may even be given a different type of bottle on a refill for the same prescription. It is important that you use the compatibility card to test every bottle that you intend to use the Nanodropper with. If you would like to know if your type of medication is produced in a compatible bottle, email us atsupport@nanodropper.com.

natural-ophthalmics-allergy-desensitization-eye-drops-10ml,Natural Ophthalmics Allergy Desensitization Eye Drops (10ml),"OVERVIEW:
Allergy Eye Drops stop allergy symptoms such as itching, burning, watering, edema, and general ocular sensitivity. The drops are a sterile, non-preserved, pH balanced, isotonic solution containing four homeopathic active ingredients. Note: For non-allergic watering (tearing) secondary to dry eye, dispense our Tear Stimulation Dry Eye Drops.

TREATMENT STRATEGY:
Allergy is a chronic condition expressed as the body's over-activity in triggering and carrying out the inflammation cascade, leading to the symptoms of itching, burning, watering, and redness. Note that suppressing symptoms with steroids, mast cell stabilizers, and antihistamines hinders the same processes that the body uses to fight bacteria and viruses. They also have the risk of adverse reactions/drug interactions and should be utilized after desensitization drops have been tried. Our drops contain micro dilutions of ingredients that are known to cause allergy if ingested in large (toxic) doses. The body reacts by desensitization-itching, burning, watering, and redness are quickly alleviated.

DIRECTIONS:
Use every 3 - 4 hours for the first 2 days (front loading) • Then back off to comfort level. • Increase frequency as needed. • With extreme allergy symptoms use hourly if needed. • Reapply at the first sign of returning symptoms.",Natural Ophthalmics,Dry Eye Products,Eye Drops,TRUE,Title,Default Title,DER5864,19.95,TRUE,TRUE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mobo4/dryeyela-hydrogen/main/public/products_processed/natural-ophthalmics-allergy-desensitization-eye-drops-10ml.png,1,Natural Ophthalmics Allergy Desensitization Eye Drops (10ml),FALSE,Natural Ophthalmics Allergy Desensitization Eye Drops (10ml) | Eye Care Center OC,Natural Ophthalmics Allergy Desensitization Eye Drops (10ml),active,continue,shopify,manual,

OVERVIEW:
These homeopathic drops trigger the transfer of oxygen and nutrients from the blood to the aqueous to nourish and detoxify the living tissue of the crystalline lens.Cineraria maritimahas been used homeopathically for over 100 years to safely and effectively treat cataract. It is the treatment of choice in Europe, India and South America.

Safe for pregnant women and children. OK for use with contact lenses in place. There are no known side effects or drug interactions.

These drops also contain Euphrasia (Eyebright) which is extremely effective for relieving dry, red, sore or tired eyes.

These drops contain powerful ingredients to stimulate tear film production, counteract irritation, halt allergies and reduce foreign body sensation. Homeopathic Calendula is known to support corneal health and is indicated for corneal abrasions and erosions. The clarifying ""Thin Drop"" is preservative-free and used as often as needed to alleviate dry, red, itchy, irritated eyes and is also OK with all contacts. The ""Thick Drop"" reduces mechanical irritation. Homeopathic drops are safe for children and nursing/pregnant women.

DIRECTIONS:
Instill one or two drops in the affected eye(s) upon waking to facilitate lens removal. Use as often as needed throughout the day to alleviate dryness, redness, or discomfort.

How do they work?
Both the Thin and Thick drops work similarly. They are a combination of some aspects of the Tear Stimulation Drops and the Allergy Desensitization Drop. In addition, they contain Calendula, which is indicated for corneal health and vitality.

What to say?
Depending upon your approach, some patients fill the Ortho-K lens with a drop of Thin or Thick. Upon waking up, use a drop of Thin for easy removal.

nictavi-disposable-device-for-nighttime-eye-lid-closure-15ct,Nictavi Disposable Device for Nighttime Eye Lid Closure (15ct),"Nictavi Disposable Device for Nighttime Eye Lid Closure (15ct)
What it is: 
The Tarsus Eyelid Patch is ideal for attaining eyelid closure for many applications, such as encouraging the healing corneal abrasions and injuries, preventing corneal erosion due to exposure, addressing lazy eye, nocturnal use for stroke survivors, and those with bell’s palsy, or those who suffer from dry eyes due to lagophthalmos. There is also a big need in the ICU for those in medically induced comas, as well as during and after surgeries, addressing keratopathy, and for the elderly with eye health complications. This product also can be used in tandem with Prokera therapy and other products or medicines that require sustained eyelid closure as a part of the therapy.

The patented Tarsus Eyelid Patch is a non-surgical strategy for prevention and management of corneal injuries and defects using eyelid closure. It is an innovative eyelid closure device and method, which utilizes the strengths of adhesion, structure, curvature and resistance. It is an affordable therapeutic that will transform cornea care and replace antiquated eyelid closure devices and techniques. Using design, simple mechanics, and the most advanced materials and adhesives, the Tarsus Eyelid Patch stands alone in effectiveness and patient comfort.

 Click to see the clinical trials of the Nictavi Tarsus Eyelid Patch that were conducted at the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. 

Instructions




Eyelid surface must be clean and dry before applying patch.


Apply centered on closed upper eyelid, above the eye opening and lashes. Rub gently to adhere. Fig A


To remove, roll your finger gently over either side edge of the patch, rolling back a portion. Grab the portion with your fingers and gently peel the patch off.


Why us? How it works

The Tarsus Eyelid Patch is an elongated octagon shape with rounded corners. It has many unique features that make it superior the other eyelid closure product options. Our product is made of breathable medical materials. It has a gentle yet aggressive adhesive that holds fast on the sensitive skin of the eyelid and removes without irritation or residue. It is comfortable and effective to wear for long periods of time. It can be worn during sleep to sustain eyelid closure when addressing nocturnal Lagophthalmos, aiding in the prevention of corneal defects or damage. It is also suitable for daytime use as an eyelid closure therapy, stabilizing the eyelid in the closed portion, retaining moisture and encouraging the body to naturally heal the cornea. For this application you would wear one patch for day use, changing for the night for the needed durations. To heal surface defects the Tarsus Patch may need to be worn for a week, or even a month changing every morning and night or as needed. More comfort, effectiveness, and less irritability, make the Tarsus Eyelid Patch ideal for pediatric use, worn under an eye shield in some cases to prevent removal. Eyelid closure or occlusion are the method to address pediatric Amblyopia or lazy eye. In young children and adolescents, it should be treated using part-time occlusion of the fellow eye and the underlying cause should be addressed.
It is applied to the upper eyelid above the eye-opening, and easily aligned and properly placed with the aid of a light blue arching line on the patch. It's design or shape, does not intrude on the eyelashes or the corners of the eyes, making it much more comfortable than other products that crush the eyelashes under them and stick the eyelids together. This is very irritating, and in some cases doesn't give a complete eyelid closure which can, in the case of sedated surgeries, even damage the cornea, in some cases causing corneal blindness. When the Tarsus Patch is applied to the closed upper eyelid, the adhesion conforms the patch to the curvatures of the eyeball, on the eyelid, and the under brow, it acquires form and structure, holding the eyelid in the closed position in resistance to the retraction of the levator muscle.

Our device and method make it possible, with one finger, to lower and open the bottom eyelid enabling a caregiver or the wearer to add medicine or artificial tears. Upon the release of the lower eyelid, the eye is closed again as the upper eyelid is held in the closed position by the applied Tarsus Patch. This gives our product the ability to accompany eye medicines, as well as for use after eye surgeries to enhance healing. There have been studies that show that eyelid closure enhances the delivery, and effectiveness of some eye medicines. It is also excellent for use during sedated surgeries and on paralyzed patients for eye closure, and has possible uses by NASA astronauts in space.

Our product is specifically designed for the essence of eyelid closure by a patient, with the wearers comfort in mind. We have put serious thought into solving the neglected problem of comfortable effective eye closure. With forward thinking design, innovation, and the latest technologies and materials, we have created a product that antiquates our competition.

In some cases partial eyelid closure is desired. This can be achieved with the Tarsus Patch by positioning at application. Application positioning is key in all cases. The wearer needs to find the application positioning or sweet spot for their individual orbital eye socket anatomy and the desired amount of eyelid closure desired.

Due to lower lid anatomy or various lower lid functionality issues it may be necessary to support the lower lid to achieve effective eyelid closure.",Nictavi,Dry Eye Products,,TRUE,Title,Default Title,DER3984,54.95,TRUE,TRUE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mobo4/dryeyela-hydrogen/main/public/products_processed/nictavi-disposable-device-for-nighttime-eye-lid-closure-15ct.png,1,Nictavi Disposable Device for Nighttime Eye Lid Closure (15ct),FALSE,Nictavi Disposable Device for Nighttime Eye Lid Closure (15ct) | Eye Care Center OC,Nictavi Disposable Device for Nighttime Eye Lid Closure (15ct),active,continue,shopify,manual,

RECOMMENDED FOR



Sleep Apnea (CPAP Leaks)


Sleep apnea is a chronic condition in which a person’s breathing is interrupted while they sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common type, which is caused by partial or complete blockage of the airways. It’s estimated that 20 million Americans suffer from this sleep disorder. Typical symptoms are snoring, waking up frequently, daytime sleepiness and morning headaches.Untreated sleep apnea increases the risk of stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart failure. Most patients are advised to use a CPAP machine (Continuous positive airway pressure machine), which ensures the brain gets enough oxygen. However, air leaks in the CPAP can cause dry eyes, dry or stuffy nose and irritated skin on your face.Sheltering the eyes from air leaks helps patients to commit to their sleep apnea treatment without suffering the side effects.

This formula features Gingko biloba &amp; flavonoids from bilberry &amp; grape seed extracts to support normal ocular blood flow and is rich in antioxidants: vitamins C, E, alpha lipoid acid and coenzyme Q10 to boost the eye’s anti-oxidative defenses; omega 3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA) &amp; magnesium; and B vitamins, taurine &amp; bioflavonoids to help keep blood vessels toned and healthy.
Clinically Tested, Manufactured to Highest Quality Standards
Optic Nerve Formula has been clinically tested (Acta Ophthalmologica, 2017). It is made from premium ingredients and manufactured in the U.S. in NSF-certified facilities under stringent GMP guidelines.
What is the Optic Nerve?
The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that connect the light-sensing retina at the back of the eye with the brain. Also called the “nerve of light”, the optic nerve is the essential link between the eye and the brain that makes vision possible.
Optic Nerve Concerns
Optic nerve health can be compromised in some eye problems where the blood supply to the nerve is interrupted as a result of increased pressure of fluid buildup in the eye or from damaged nerve cells. Oxidative stress and poor blood flow are found to play a role.
Supporting Optic Nerve Health
Optic Nerve Formula supports normal vascular and nerve function, prompt ocular blood flow and increased protective antioxidant intake.",ScienceBased Health,Dry Eye Products,Supplements,TRUE,Title,Default Title,DER1993,50.3,TRUE,TRUE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mobo4/dryeyela-hydrogen/main/public/products_processed/optic-nerve-formula-nutrition-support-for-optic-nerve-health-120ct.png,1,"Optic Nerve Formula, Nutrition Support for Optic Nerve Health (120ct)",FALSE,"Optic Nerve Formula, Nutrition Support for Optic Nerve Health (120ct) | Eye Care Center OC","Optic Nerve Formula, Nutrition Support for Optic Nerve Health (120ct)",active,continue,shopify,manual,

Patients with tear deficiency and meibomian gland disease have an overgrowth of ocular flora. This overgrowth is thought to contribute to the tear film instability and ocular surface damage. Both topical and systemic antibiotics can significantly reduce the Colony Forming Units (CFUs) in eyes with chronic lid disease. With the increase of resistance among ocular pathogens (Cernak et al 2011), the efficacy of antibiotic therapeutic regimens is being reduced.

Application of Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drop 3 times daily to the inferior conjunctival fornix can significantly reduce CFUs from baseline at month 1 in the eyelids of patients with dry eye caused by tear deficiency and/or meibomian gland disease.

Reduction of CFUs reduces the potential susceptibility of the dry eye patient to bacterial conjunctivitis and keratitis. The reduction in CFUs may also assist in improving the clinical symptoms of dry eye disease by reducing the production of certain bacterial lipases that are thought to hydrolyse meibomian gland lipids.

Albietz and Lenton also reported that the application of medical-grade Leptospermum sp honey (Manuka) was associated with significant clinical improvements in dry eye and meibomian gland dysfunction. The only adverse effects noted with the use of Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drop in the eye are stinging and redness.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR THE OXYSEPT® DISINFECTING SOLUTION/NEUTRALIZER-ULTRACARE® FORMULA

A disinfecting, neutralizing and storage system for soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses, including daily and extended wear in a chemical (not heat) lens care system. Included in the Oxysept® System is Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution/Neutralizer.
Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution/Neutralizer consists of:
Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution - a sterile 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for lens disinfection.
Oxysept® Neutralizing Tablets - a delayed-release neutralizing tablet that is added at the beginning of the disinfection cycle, and colors the solution pink to show that the tablet has been added. This tablet allows disinfection to occur before neutralizing the solution all in one easy step.
Oxysept® Cup - a specially designed lens cup that must be used with this system.

DIRECTIONS FOR USE
Follow the instructions below each time you remove your contact lenses. Always wash, rinse and dry hands with a lint-free towel before handling contact lenses. Always remove the same lens first to avoid mix-ups.
1. Clean and Rinse Your Lenses
Remove and handle one lens at a time. Gently rub each lens with an appropriate daily cleaner. Rinse thoroughly with sterile saline solution. Place the lens in the appropriate basket of the lens holder attached to the cap and close the basket lid. For easy identification, the left lens basket is blue.
2. Disinfect and Neutralize Your Lenses
Fill the Oxysept® Cup to the fill line with Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution. With dry hands, remove one Oxysept® Neutralizing Tablet from the blister card, drop into the solution and immediately place the lens holder containing the lenses into the Oxysept®Cup. Tighten the cap.
Gently turn the Oxysept® Cup upside down, then right side up 3 consecutive times to wet the upper surfaces of the cup and the inside of the cap. Make sure that the tablet is in the solution. The Oxysept® Neutralizing Tablet will color the solution pink. This is normal and expected. The pink coloration provides an easy visual reminder that you have added your neutralizing tablet. The color does not indicate that your lenses are neutralized or ready to wear. You must still soak your lenses for a minimum of 6 hours after the addition of the Oxysept® Neutralizing Tablet. You will see a few bubbles or some light bubbling. If the tablet immediately begins to bubble vigorously, causing foam to form on the solution surface, the tablet is neutralizing the solution too quickly for disinfection to take place. Discard the solution and tablet, fill the cup with fresh solution, add another tablet and immediately tighten the cap. Allow the lenses to soak for a minimum of 6 hours to overnight. The delayed-release Oxysept® Neutralizing Tablet will allow disinfection to occur before it neutralizes the solution. During the neutralization process, the tablet will begin to bubble vigorously and will completely dissolve. If the solution is not pink, you have not added an Oxysept® Neutralizing tablet to the solution.
Note: In clinical studies a small percentage of patients reported that their lenses appeared slightly pink. This temporary lens coloration does not damage your lenses, and washes away shortly after lens application.
3. Wear
Before removing lenses from the lens case, turn the lens case upside down, to ensure full neutralization of all residual disinfecting solution in the lens case. Then apply the lenses directly to your eyes. If desired, rinse your lenses with sterile saline solution, before lens application. Do not use Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution (hydrogen peroxide) to rinse your lenses before wearing.
If you do not intend to wear your lenses immediately after disinfection/neutralization, you may store them in the unopened Oxysept® Cup. Disinfect and neutralize with fresh solution once a week and before applying the lenses to your eyes.To prevent contamination and to help avoid serious eye injury, always empty and rinse cup with sterile rinsing solution and allow to air dry. Once a week, while you are wearing your lenses, fill the Oxysept®  Cup with fresh Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution (do not add an Oxysept® Neutralizing Tablet). Tighten the cap. Turn the cup upside down to allow the solution to cover the inside of the cap and the top part of the cup. Leave the cup in this position until you are ready to remove your lenses from your eyes and disinfect.
Note: Once a week, simply add an Ultrazyme® Enzymatic Cleaner tablet to the Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution at the same time that you add the Oxysept® Neutralizing Tablet. You will simultaneously reduce the buildup of protein on your soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses as you disinfect and neutralize them. For more information, see the Ultrazyme® Enzymatic Cleaner package insert, or ask your eye care professional.

PROBLEMS WITH CONTACT LENSES AND LENS CARE PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY TO THE EYE.
It is essential that you follow your eye care professional's directions and all labeling instructions for proper use and care of your lenses and lens care products, including the lens case. 
EYE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING CORNEAL ULCERS, CAN DEVELOP RAPIDLY AND LEAD TO LOSS OF VISION.
Daily wear lenses are not indicated for overnight wear and should not be worn while sleeping. Clinical studies have shown that the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when these lenses are worn overnight. Extended wear lenses should be regularly removed for cleaning and disinfection or for disposal and replacement on the schedule prescribed by your eye care professional. Clinical studies have shown that there is an increased incidence of serious adverse reactions in extended wear contact lens users as compared to daily wear contact lens users. Studies have also shown that the risk of serious adverse reactions increases the longer extended wear lenses are worn before removal for cleaning and disinfection or for disposal and replacement. Studies have also shown that smokers had a higher incidence of adverse reactions. It is recommended that contact lens wearers see their eye care professional twice each year, or if directed, more frequently. To avoid contamination, do not touch the tip of the Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution to any surface. Replace cap after using.
PRECAUTIONS
Always wash, rinse and dry hands with a lint-free towel before handling lenses.Always clean, disinfect and neutralize your lenses each time they are removed.If the blister card appears damaged in any way, DO NOT USE any tablet from that card. Use a tablet from another card to neutralize the peroxide.Use only Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution/Neutralizer components; do not substitute.Never reuse solutions.Do not use tablets that appear to be broken or chipped.Always ensure that the tablet has fully dissolved and that bubbling has stopped before putting your lenses into your eyes. If the tablet has not dissolved fully, repeat the disinfection and neutralization stages.Do not take tablets internally.After reapplying your lenses, always empty the Oxysept® Cup, rinse with sterile saline solution, and allow to air dry.Store solutions and tablets at room temperature.Use before the expiration date marked on the bottle, blister card and cartons.Never use Oxysept® Disinfecting Solution or Oxysept® Neutralizing Tablets in a heat disinfection unit as these products are not designed for use with heat disinfection.
ADVERSE REACTIONS AND WHAT TO DO:
The following may occur:Eyes stinging, burning, or itching (irritation)Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyesUnusual eye secretionsRedness of the eyesReduced sharpness of vision (visual acuity)Blurred visionSensitivity to lightDry eyes
If you notice any of the above symptoms, IMMEDIATELY remove and examine your lenses. If a lens appears to be damaged, do not reapply; consult your eye care professional. If the symptom stops and the lenses appear to be undamaged, follow the complete “Directions for Use”, below, before reapplying them. If the symptom continues, IMMEDIATELY remove your lenses, discontinue use of all lens care products that contact the eye, and consult your eye care professional.

What it is: Clinically proven dry eye relief: A clinical study has shown that taking 2240mg of EPA/DHA in the re-esterified triglyceride form (rTG) for 90 days results in improvement of occasional dry eye symptoms such as grittiness, dryness, and burning.

Can produce optimal levels of omega-3s in 90 days

Instructions: 
Three softgels once daily with a meal, or as directed by your healthcare professional

Product FAQ

Q: How does De 3 compare to store-bought fish oil?A: De 3 contains 2240mg of EPA and DHA in an ultra-purified triglyceride (rTG) form, which is a similar form to a piece of fish, but without the impurities. This form is easier for your body to absorb and micro-distilled to remove contaminants like PCBs, lead, mercury and more.  Many store-bought omega-3s contain less than 600mg of EPA and DHA and are in a synthetic (ester) or unpurified form, which is difficult to absorb and leaves a fishy odor/aftertaste.
Q: Can I get a sufficient amount of Omega-3s from just eating fish?A: The American Heart Association and the American Cardiology Association recommend 2-3 grams of omega-3s daily (EPA+DHA). To get this amount of Omega 3s (generally equal to 3 soft gels of PRN Omega 3s daily) from eating fish, you would have to consume the equivalent of 37 cans of tuna per week! Eating this much fish could result in an increased risk for mercury poisoning. Other fish that can be purchased in stores are mostly farm-raised which have little Omega-3s, or wild-caught, which are optimal but have an increased risk of being contaminated with harmful PCBs, dioxins, mercury, etc.
Q:Why not Flaxseed oilA: Flaxseed contains the plant source of Omega-3s, also known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). This form is less easy to absorb and less effective in the body. Marine-based Omega-3s have been shown to be more absorbable which may provide systemic benefits.*

Sleep Apnea (CPAP Leaks)


Sleep apnea is a chronic condition in which a person’s breathing is interrupted while they sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common type, which is caused by partial or complete blockage of the airways. It’s estimated that 20 million Americans suffer from this sleep disorder. Typical symptoms are snoring, waking up frequently, daytime sleepiness and morning headaches.Untreated sleep apnea increases the risk of stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart failure. Most patients are advised to use a CPAP machine (Continuous positive airway pressure machine), which ensures the brain gets enough oxygen. However, air leaks in the CPAP can cause dry eyes, dry or stuffy nose and irritated skin on your face.Sheltering the eyes from air leaks helps patients to commit to their sleep apnea treatment without suffering the side effects.

They will fully convert back to nature and do not require recycling. At The Body Doctor, we recognise that being sustainable is becoming a necessity due to ever-changing perceptions around the world and we are starting to bridge the gap between ‘knowing’ and ‘doing,’ by embracing sustainable products, packaging and practises. We believe our eyelid wipes being biodegradable is a first for the optical industry and we are dedicated to continue this initiative across our whole portfolio, reducing as much impact to the environment as possible.

What it is: Our patented tranquileyes® eye hydrating therapy is doctor-recommended and scientifically proven to relieve moderate dry eyes. Soothing 12 to 15 minute compresses sustain optimum humidity and temperature (between 102-110°F) that industry studies have shown provide immediate and long-term relief from Dry Eye.  Interchanging thermoeyes™ Beads and thermoeyes™ Instants allows flexibility in choosing the treatment type that best works with your day.
About Tranquileyes: The beautifully sculpted eyecups are made from FDA-approved medical grade thermal plastic, and viscoelastic memory foam designed to seal and conform naturally. Resting over the orbital bones, the design allows for optimal blood flow to vital arteries above the nose without placing unnecessary pressure on the sensitive blood vessels under the eye. The comfort wrap is wide in the back and narrows toward the temples for maximum comfort. The wrap is easily adjusted with two specially designed sliders, to ensure a custom fit and complete seal of the goggle to the eye area.  Recommended for moderate to severe evaporative Dry Eye (MGD), ocular allergies, moderate to severe blepharitis, Demodex infestation, lid margin inflammation, eyelid and under-eye puffiness.
Latex-free and made in the USA.

One tranquileyes xl® goggle

One set of black foam inserts
Three sets of thermoeyes™ Instants XL
One set of Beads XL
Two sets of XL white fabric pockets
One mesh bag for Beads and washing
One microfiber storage bag

Instructions:

To prepare moist-heat therapies, microwave the Beads in their fabric pockets and mesh bag in 1 cup of water for 45 seconds. Let stand for 1 minute.* Carefully remove Beads from net bag and insert into the back of the goggle. Please test Beads are not too hot to the touch before placing over closed eyelids.
*If you do not have a microwave, place net bag containing pocketed Beads into 1 cup of hot water. Do not use boiling water. Cover and let stand for 2 minutes. 
If you prefer to use the Instants, simply activate them by clicking the disc inside the gel pack back and forth until it starts generating heat. Place Instants inside moistened fabric pockets and into the back of the goggle.
Don’t forget to submerge and boil the Instants gel packs after each use for 2-3 minutes to reset them (Do not leave unattended). Carefully remove gel packs with a spoon and place on a towel to cool. Do not handle while cooling. The gel packs should be ready for reuse in approximately 30 minutes.
For cold treatments, insert Instants or Beads with fabric pockets into the back of the goggle. Place the goggles in a self-sealing plastic bag and leave in the freezer for 20-30 minutes. Once the goggle is removed from the bag, place over closed eyelids. Wear for 15 minutes or as directed by your eye doctor.
You can also sleep with the goggle and moisten the black foam inserts to increase humidity around the eyes.

Tips for Handling &amp; Caring for Scleral Lenses

Thoroughly wash your hands with mild, lotion-free soap, and dry them with a clean, lint-free towel before inserting and removing lenses. 
Use fresh solution every time you store lenses. Never re-use or top off an old solution.
Replace your lens cases every time you buy a new bottle of lens storage solution.
Never use tap or bottled water on lenses — only &lt; target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""&gt;saline and other approved solutions.
Fill each scleral lens completely with saline solution before inserting; this will help prevent bubbles.
Try not to rub your eyes during the day. If lenses feel uncomfortable, remove them, rinse and refill them with saline solution before re-inserting.

Tips for Inserting Scleral Lenses

Place the lens on the center of the insertion plunger and over-fill the lens bowl with saline solution.
Hold both eyelids open and place your head so it is parallel with the countertop or table holding your lenses. For extra help, place a mirror flat on the table.
Use the insertion plunger to gently place the lens onto the eye while keeping both eyelids open. If you push the lens too firmly on the eye, you may experience discomfort and lens fogging.
Quickly, but gently, release the lower lid, then the upper lid once the lens touches your eye. If a small amount of saline spills out of the bowl, you’ll know you have used enough solution.
Check that there are no bubbles under the lens and that the lens is centered. If you need to adjust the lens, remove it and re-insert with fresh saline solution.

Tips for Removing Scleral Lenses

Wet the tip of the removal plunger with saline solution.
Hold both eyelids open and press the suction cup of the removal plunger onto the bottom, outer portion of the scleral lens.
Gently pull the removal plunger upwards and outwards from the eye to break suction and remove the lens.
Store your lenses in a clean case with fresh solution.

Even better, the ingredients in the formula work to minimize the symptoms of dry eye disease with daily use while promoting softer skin and healthier-looking lashes.

Say Goodbye to Annoying Eye Floaters
Take 1 softgel daily, preferably with a mealDo not exceed stated dose
Between the lens and retina is the vitreous, a clear gel-like substance made up of water, hyaluronic acid and collagen fibers. This part of the eye needs specific antioxidants to protect it against oxidative stress and disease. Research shows the vitreous loses these nutrients over time, causing the collagen fibers inside it to clump together. These clumps, called floaters, cast shadows on the retina, disrupting your vision.
VitreousHealth is the first scientifically proven supplement to manage this irritating condition, offering patients a natural option to reduce the symptoms of floaters. Its patented blend replenishes the vitreous with the antioxidants needed to reduce the severity of floaters.
VitreousHealth is based on the ground-breaking double-blind, placebo-controlled Floater Intervention Study (FLIES).1 In that study, 67% of patients recognized an improvement in their symptoms within six months with a noticeable enhancement in contrast sensitivity and visual comfort.
Product Description
• First scientifically proven non-invasive solution to treat eye floaters• Pharmaceutical grade dietary supplement• Patented blend of antioxidants• All natural ingredients and lactose-free• Made in the USA in a GMP facility and third-party tested for quality and safety
Uses
• Reduces the severity of floaters• Significantly improves contrast sensitivity and daily visual experience• Decreases vitreous opacity and visual discomfort
Active Ingredients

125 mg L-lysine: An essential amino acid, necessary for human health, but not produced by the body. L-lysine prevents collagen glycation.
40 mg Vitamin C: Guards against intraocular oxidative stress by consuming oxygen released at the vitreoretinal interface.
26.3 mg Vitis Vinifera: Grapeseed extract. Of which 25 mg are Proanthocyanidins, which reduce glycation.
5 mg Zinc: Helps reduce processes that lead to vitreous degeneration. Additionally, zinc has antioxidant and antiglycation properties.
100 mg Citrus Fruit Extract* of which 60 mg is Hesperidin, an antioxidant

Inactive Ingredients

HPMC is the capsule, which is a Veggie Capsule.
MCC is Microcrystalline cellulose, it is refined wood pulp and is used as a texturizer, an anti-caking agent, a fat substitute, an emulsifier, an extender, and a bulking agent in food production.
Silica (silicon dioxide) is found naturally in many plant food sources. Silicon dioxide is also added to many foods and supplements. As a food additive, it serves as an anticaking agent to avoid clumping. In supplements, it’s used to prevent the various powdered ingredients from sticking together.
